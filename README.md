# PDF Annotator

By Patrick Lee

### Set-up

1. Clone repository or download project files to local machine.
2. If using VS Code, download/use Live Server extension. If not using VS Code, skip to Step #4
3. If the browser window does not automatically open, go to the proper port on localhost to view (on my machine, Live Server's default port is 5500)
4. Move/Copy project files to the proper local server folder (i.e. htdocs)
5. Start a local server (i.e. XAMPP)
6. In a browser, open up the proper port on localhost to view (XAMPP Apache server defaults to port 9090 for me)

### How to use

1. The provided sample.pdf file will be shown in the canvas in the browser window.
2. Click and drag mouse pointer to draw a red rectangle anywhere on the canvas.
3. Clicking and dragging mouse pointer again will clear the previous "annotation" and begin drawing a new red rectangle.
4. Once finished, click the download button to save the annotated PDF to your machine (default name is final.pdf).
5. To change which file you would like to display and/or annotate, replace the provided sample.pdf with desired PDF file with the same name (sample.pdf).
